        <p>Hey Tsubaki,</p>
        <p>How are you? I hope you are doing well. Seems like a letter from 8th grade, uhh?</p>
        <p>I've a lot to say to you, maybe it's not my place to show comfort. There are people with good heart for that.
          Remember the night I promised you to gift a black rose. I failed so sorry. Forgive me, love!</p>
        <p>I'm the reason of your tears, so it's not my place to show rights over you.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry for everything I have done to you.</p>
        <p>I'm really sorry.</p>
        <p>I hope you'll achieve your dreams as well as become a good doctor</p>
        <p>I love you a lot my vendi, my comfort, my love</p>
        <p>I love you 10 billion.ðŸ§¡</p>
